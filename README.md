Thank you for your interest in CASPER. Our packaged releases for Windows 10, MacOS, and Ubuntu 18.04 will be posted soon. In the meantime, you can run CASPERapp with python3 following the directions below.

### How to run CASPERapp using python3:
1) Clone the repository
2) Ensure that you have Python3 installed on your computer (Python 3.6 recommended).
3) We have coded in a requirements file such that dependencies CASPER operates on should be automatically downloaded to your computer.
If this does not work and you have a dependency issue, please use pip or anaconda to install the appropriate packages given in
the warnings.
6) Run CASPER!  Simply cd into the CASPERapp-master directory (wherever you put it) and run the command: "python3 main.py"
CASPER will launch and you will be good to go!
