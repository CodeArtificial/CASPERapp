# CASPERapp

Thank you for your interest in CASPER.  Please visit the Release page to download the CASPERapp executable for your OS; otherwise, you can download the source code, and run the CASPERapp using Python3.

### To run CASPERapp using python3:
1) Clone the repository
2) Ensure that you have Python3 installed on your computer (Python 3.6 recommended).
3) We have coded in a requirements file such that dependencies CASPER operates on should be automatically downloaded to your computer.
If this does not work and you have a dependency issue, please use pip or anaconda to install the appropriate packages given in
the warnings.
6) Run CASPER!  Simply cd into the CASPERapp-master directory (wherever you put it) and run the command: "python3 main.py"
CASPER will launch and you will be good to go!

Any problems please email David Dooley at ddooley2@vols.utk.edu
